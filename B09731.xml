            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface</head>
            <head>To the Youthful Gentry.</head>
            <p>IT hath been ſuch an hereditary practice for the Author, to declare to the Reader the depth of his deſign, that ſhould I decline this cuſtom, I ſhould not free my Endeavors from the nice exceptions of the too curious Criticks of theſe times. When Playes were at their height, Prologues were ſo in faſhion at the Court, and ſo deſired on the Stage, that without them the Audience could not be pleaſed; ſo that the beſt Poets were forced to ſatisfie the greedy expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the multitude, that gaped and yawned for ſuch ſet and ſtarcht ſpeeches to be gravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to their Worſhips by the man in the long cloak with the coloured beard. It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Mr. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> that though he writ with ſuch a free and ſparkling Genious, that future Ages ſhall ſcarce ever parallel, yet his importunate Commedians would often croud upon him ſuch impertinences, which to him ſeem needleſs and lame excuſes, his Works being ſo good, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation rendred them as the only bad Lines his modeſt <hi>Thalia</hi> was ever humbled with. The truth is, when an Author hath ſet down well, and ſo deſcended to his Readers capacity, that
<pb facs="tcp:188088:5"/> his Muſe is obvious and eaſie to be underſtood, what needs there a Clavis or a Thred where there is no Labyrinth; notwithſtanding, we cannot but be ſenſible that ſome Prefaces have ſo abuſed the credulous Readers truſt, that they cannot now be too ſlightly ſet by, as moſt of them may; and that not improperly, be fitly compared to rich capparriſon'd Jades, to painted Inn-poſts, to Wenches admirably trickt forth, but pull off their dreſſings, and they look like flead Cats. What the Country-man ſaid of the Nightingale, <hi>Nox &amp; praeterea nihil,</hi> A great cry and no wool, may be rightly applied to them. I acknowledge, Courteous Reader, that as I have already in my Epiſtle to the <hi>Coy Ladies,</hi> diſcourſt Jovially and Ironically of Love, as alſo in my other Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, treated by way of Introduction, of the right management of Eloquence and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if I had not ſtill inforced my Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to further ſerious and uſeful Inſtructions, for my Readers greater benefit, this Preface had been like thoſe I have found fault with, ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; or at leaſt to little purpoſe. And now it will be expected, nor can I do otherwiſe, then make an ingenious confeſſion, why I ſet thoſe ſubjects of Love and Complements apart by themſelves; I ſhall give my Reader ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that I might not juſtle too much matter into this Preface, which I only intend for a Landskip to the Work, my whole deſign being included in theſe two particulars. Firſt, why I have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed this Volume. Secondly, what Profit and Delight an underſtanding Reader may expect
<pb facs="tcp:188088:5"/> to drive to himſelf from his diligent peruſal of it.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, to deal plainly with my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men, the ſeveral ſimple Pamphlets that have treated ſo ſurreptitiouſly of this ſubject, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted this employment from me; as I could not but be highly incenſed, to ſee them ſo cheated and baffled by ſuch ſpecious pretenders, but moſt wretched performers of what they undertook. I will not vex my Reader with the Names or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles they are diſtinguiſht or dignified with, I hope by this time all Ingenious Perſons have learnt ſufficiently to deteſt them. For my own part, in theſe my Studies I have not ſo much as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any other notice of them, then to ſhun the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their papers; and though ſome may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that the Green is the ſame that we bowl on, ſuch perſons, if they make but the leaſt inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall quickly find that my Byas is turned another way, my flight is higher, my engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are different; for without any vain glory I may confidently atteſt to the world, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of ſeveral perſons of Honour, as well by their particular preſcriptions, as alſo by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of their choiſeſt Manuſcripts, built up this Volume. It took its birth from them, to whom with a moſt ſincere gratitude it doth again hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly dedicate it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For my ſecond Conſideration, what benefit the Peruſer of this Book is likely to acquire to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I ſhall expreſs to him in few words; he hath, as I may rightly call it, a Magazin richly furniſht, for his diſpatch of any of thoſe high Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:188088:6"/> 
               <hi>Cupid</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi> ſhall at any time inſtate him in; all manner of Adreſſes, Entertainments, and Ceremonies, whether of Salutation, Love or Court-ſhip, which are comprehended under thoſe Heads of Wooing and Complements; from whence as from two Springs, the other leſſer ſtreams do diſtill, whether of Proſe or Verſe, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or Drolling Subjects in Letters, or otherwiſe; theſe contain in them, a grand part of the body of this Work; for the other Additions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, Poſies, Characters, Jeaſts, Clinches, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, &amp;c. as alſo the <hi>Miſcelania,</hi> of Natural, Amorous, Moral, Experimental, Paradoxical, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmatical, and Jovial Queſtions with their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, I am confident they will no leſs inrich the Readers Mind, then admirably delight his Fancy. As for the ſeveral <hi>A-la-mode</hi> Games and Sports, I have inſerted them with ſuch plain demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that any perſon of a reaſonable capacity, may quickly be expert in them; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have invented a Riming Dictionary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Monaſyllables, for the ending of Verſes, applicable for thoſe that are yong Practioners in the pleaſant Sport named <hi>Crambo:</hi> together with another particular Alphabet, intituled, <hi>The triall of Wits,</hi> which conſiſts of Epithets, properly fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for immediate uſe, on the ſudden occaſions of Writing or Diſcourſe, which I have alſo appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the other Recreation, ſo much in faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, called Subſtantives and Adjectives. And that the Ingenious Reader may be aſſured of my care and induſtry, to render this Book worthy of his acceptance, I have alſo preſented him with a
<pb facs="tcp:188088:6"/> compleat Tract of the Art of Logick by way of Queſtion and Anſwer, ſo clearly delineated, that the Judicious Student may in a ſhort time attain to a competent knowledge of thoſe moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ways of Arguing and Diſputing, ſo much practiſed in the Univerſities.</p>
            <p>How advantagious this work will be to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Perſons, will more eaſily be inſtanced, if we rightly conſider the incongruity of mens parts, and look narrowly into their gifts; one ſpeaks well, but writes improperly, another im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys his pen in excellent ſence, but wants good language; another hath a good invention but no method; ſo that whatſoever ſome of our Moderns pretend to their <hi>ex tempore</hi> inſpirations, it cannot but be confeſſed by all men in their right minds, that Artificial ſet Forms may be aiding to them all, not as they are litterally to be applied but as they are additional helps to quicken and enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Genius. This my aſſertion will be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made good, if we do but conſider the ſmooth effeminate ſilken tribe, how ſome of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean themſelves, who if they are put to it on ſudden alarums or unexpected ſummons of their fancies by letters, or otherwiſe, how are they forced in ſuch exigents, to have recourſe to their Romances, Plays, Manuſcripts, and ſuch like Common place books, they turn down the page, tranſcribe, and for the preſent ſubſiſt on ſuch ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der notions. How without bluſhing can I expreſs it, that I have known a wench of fourteen, with a few Dramatical
<hi>Drayton</hi> and <hi>Sidney</hi> Quillets, put to the <hi>non plus</hi> a Gallant of thirty; I may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:188088:7"/> diſpoſe on it, that I have heard ſuch a Laſs defeat a Gentleman of ſome years ſtanding at the Inns of Court.</p>
            <p>To thoſe that ſcruple at Complemental Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Tenders of Service, I poſitively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that ſuch nimble applications, if rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, are moſt abſolutely uſeful; and that thoſe which have been adorned with ſuch qualifications have had ſuch tall advantages over others, as ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never to fall ſhort of their ends; more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when their good behaviours have been ſet off with Eloquence, which though it often carries with it ſelf a falſe fire, yet if it be ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſcreetly manag'd, it works wonders, not only for the preſent, but future times to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at. Not to detain the worthy Reader with any longer ſuſpence of ſo unqueſtioned a truth, I ſhall only deſire thee to take notice, that theſe my endeavours had a gentle riſe, ſo they ſtill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them a more than ordinary ſplendor; as they have ſhuned the common rode of all former Writers, ſo that if with <hi>Phaeton</hi> my muſe is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times placed in the Chariot of the Sun, that ſhe ſoars at the higheſt and moſt generous Deſigns; ſhe may apologize for her ſelf, that it was not her ambition, but the commands of ſeveral noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe importunity from her moſt ſerious Studies diverted her ſo far, as to make her parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of their recreations, whether they took the air in the

            <p>INcouraged by your former inexpreſſible favors, I am at this time emboldned to proſtrate theſe my Devoirs at your feet: after your Ladiſhips e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs from the <hi>Spring Garden,</hi> I was invited by the pleaſure of the ſeaſon, into the ſolitary reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſs of an Arbour, where in my Tale-book I intended to inſert ſome ſlender Obſervations of thoſe harmleſs Tranſactions and civil Frolicks, that had paſt betwixt you and your Servants, whoſe entertainments you had graced that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the ſerene influences of your propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſmiles. I had ſcarce for the recreation of my Genius, employed my pen to the draught of the firſt Character, when of a ſudden from a ſhady Grove, I heard a mournful hollow ſound, which at the firſt, I imagined to have been occaſioned by ſome freſh gale of wind, that had only ruſtled among the trees, till aſcertained otherwiſe by the iteration of a Heart-tearing groan: I was ſo far diſturbed as to caſt my eye of one ſide, where I ſoon diſcovered a woful weight; who by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly poſture, and leaning of himſelf ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentedly againſt a tree, as if he ſupported it; I could not but with probability of reaſon at the the firſt ſight determine, to be ſome wretched In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amarato,
<pb facs="tcp:188088:9"/> ſome Love-ſick perſon; ſuch an one whom the blinde God hath more fiercely woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then the twelve ſigns of the Anatomy. A diſmal object he was, and ſo repreſented to my view, as if his misfortune had ruined him ſo at once, as that he could not be rendred more unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate; he lookt as if one of your Ladiſhips had whiſpered into his ear that doleful tune of <hi>Adieu,</hi> or at leaſt that deſperate ſentence, Miſcreant, thou ſhalt lie alone with thy bed unwarmed a ſcore of froſty Winters. It cannot be amiſs, by your Ladiſhips fair permiſſions, to draw the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from before this Love Martyrs picture, to deſcribe him to you, <hi>vultu, geſtu, &amp; oculis,</hi> juſt as I then found him ſuffering his ten Perſecutions; his Hat in one place, with papers of Verſes in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, were ſo fantaſtically diſperſed on the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Graſs, that if he pleaſed, with his Feet he might ſpurn the wantonneſs of his own Muſe: for I perceived by the baldneſs of his crown with ſcratching, that he had lately been delivered of Acroſticks and Encomiums, in praiſe of ſome of your Beauties. After the writing of which, for fear of a non acceptance, he was moſt peſtilently dogged, and as I then found him, in ſuch a ſullen ſtation, yet were not his eyes ſo ſet in the hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his head, but that I diſcerned from them ſuch diliberate and heavy motions, as cauſed me, had I not been convinced by the former ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of his diſeaſe, to have ſuſpected, whether otherwiſe, according to his education, he were not ſome Clown, who having miſtaken the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack, wept for fair weather. Certain I am
<pb facs="tcp:188088:9"/> that I ſaw a moſt pitiful object, one that I could not but conceive that his Miſtreſs had frowned on, and he in requital thought for a foil, to ſhew her a worſer face then her own. I proteſt to your Ladiſhips, after I had entertained my moſt ſerious thoughts of him, I could not but take him for ſuch an unthrift, as had ſpent the beſt ſtock of wits in adoration of his Ladies Looking-glaſs; I approacht nearer to him; not Imagining but that he would at length have diſimpriſoned to his thoughts in ſome diſcourſe; for indeed after a ſtricter ſurveigh of his preſence, he ſeemed to me as if he indeavoured to hew and faſhion out his conceptions to ſome purpoſe, though I am confident they proved as unprofitable to him, as an unfiniſht piece of Artifice; what weight he poiſed in his Perricranium, I cannot well gueſs, but thus much I obſerved, that ſometimes his head hung down to his breaſt, like the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter boys brother; till of a ſudden he aſſumed more confirmed imaginations of his Miſtreſſes kindneſs, which in an inſtant placed it again, and fixt it right, as it was before, on its own Pedeſtal; his face was ſcorcht with his Ladies eyes, as if he bin a three years voiage at the
<hi>Indies,</hi> I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded his very Soul was tanned, for beauty hath the ſame influence with the ſun, it blacks within, as his brighter beams do burn without. Bleſs me from <hi>Cupid,</hi> O Miſtreſs! thought I, give me a friend and good wine. But to proceed in my deſcription, I vow to your Ladiſhips, he hath ſo ſtrictly manacled himſelf, that his arms ſeemed pinnioned, like rabits feet to a ſpit, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:188088:10"/> like the ſtrings of a book; in ſuch a poſture he ſhowed, as if he had been all contemplation, no action; like a woful Jeſuit, that had forſaken the world, ſo as never to riſe from before his Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix; one might have taken him for a ſtatue, had not his ſighs breathed from his heaved-up heart, a kind of a living death, which together with ſudden ſtartings cauſed a paleneſs ſometimes to overcome the otherwiſe more dusky colour of his face, even ſo as that ſame time, to diſcover that in <hi>diebus illis,</hi> his cheeks had entertained ſome tell-tale bluſhes, and dimpled ſmiles. His afflictions were ſo merciful to him, that to my better apprehenſion his very tears were of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign uſe, which as they then guſht forth, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to quench thoſe flames his Miſtreſſes eyes had kindled, which otherwiſe would have ſcorcht him to aſhes, and to this purpoſe I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive they did diſtil all the ſeaſons of the year. I could not but laugh at the cloaths he wore, which were ſo far from <hi>A-la-mode,</hi> that I rather conceive he had miſtaken one piece for another; as if he had put on his breeches for his doublet, the buttons wherof, were moſt of them off, for at every ſigh that came from him, like Poppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, half a dozen of them dropt at a time. At this ſtrange diſguiſe of his habit, together with the further waggery of the blinde God, I could not but cry out, Fie, when I ſaw how his garters were tied in the wrong place; about his neck, as if he had received his <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and ſhould want no accommodation for his journey to the Elizian fields, whither certainly his ſtragling thoughts had
<pb facs="tcp:188088:10"/> already tranſported him; for he appeared to me, as if he dreamt waking of ſome buſineſs that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned another world. Alas cruel Fair Ones, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of your pitty, without my more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune addreſs, he had been for too much loving, your moſt unhappy Victim. When I firſt begun to break the ſilence of that place, where all things were as ſtill as night, he heard me with his eyes, his ears followed his minde, which I perceived was not then at leaſure, as he was at that time all things but himſelf; but having now at length recollected ſo much ſtrength as to breath a few horſe ſighs, for as then he wanted other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to ſpeak his misfortunes, ſo deſperately had this idolatrous Lover faln ſick of his Goddeſs. At length after he had beſtowed on me an angry nod, for the ſtrangeneſs of my intruſion on the privacy of his thoughts, he ſtarted forth into an unuſual kinde of furious madneſs, unclaſping his arms, which before I ſuppoſe could never have been untwined, he fell to beating and thumping of his breaſt. I could not chuſe at that time, but be merrily conceited, that this incenſed rage of his, might ariſe from ſome diſpleaſure he took, that his Invention could not preſently teem with ſome Anagram, as fruitful as his Miſtreſſes name. To be breif, I was amaz'd to think into how many ſtrange ſhapes this Paſſion of Love transforms us, what Owls and Monkies it makes of us; in truth, the variety of antick tricks he played, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the vain apparitions, that queſtionleſs at that time peopled his brain, rendred him to my thinking, the moſt unfit perſon that ever I
<pb facs="tcp:188088:11"/> ſaw for any humane converſe: I aſſure you, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſo monſtrous and fatal to the moſt eminent Heroes of the world in all Ages, have the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your implacable Sex proved. Not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your Ladiſhips any longer with the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of this diſtracted Lovers Herculian paſſions, by degrrees after he had a while held his hands, with a little chafing of his temples, ſtopping of his ears, tweaking of his noſe, he came again to himſelf, and then croſſing his breaſt, after a few lamentable Ay mee's he removed from the tree, into which, till then, I thought he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted. It was now night, whereof he was ſo ſenſible, as alſo of his late indiſpoſition, that he requeſted my company with him out of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. As we walkt, I diſcourſed the ſtrangeneſs of his diſtemper, for I durſt not acknowledge his Love to be a diſeaſe, leaſt I ſhould have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned his prejudice, ſo far, as for him to have eſteemed it to have been incurable. We agreed to go to the Tavern, where, after we had luſtily quaft the Blood of the Grape, I preſented him with this Book of the <hi>Myſteries of Love,</hi> which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with clapping of warm trenchers to his Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo perfecty and ſpeedily recovered him, that within a few dayes after I met him in
<hi>Bloomes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> with freſh Roſes in his Cheeks, he lookt as if his Soul were returned to its right home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>probatum eſt.</hi> Thus have I given your fair Ladiſhips a large, but no Empirical, relation of the cure of this mad Lover, without either caſting of his Urine, or any other Charms on his Miſtreſs, except they are ſuch as are contained
<pb facs="tcp:188088:11"/> in this Book, the Witchcrafts of Eloquence, and the right Arts of Wooing; which as I hear, have ſince taken her Fort in, and that they are now happily married, I wiſh them all joy; only I thought fit in this my Epiſtle, to give your coy Ladiſhips notice, what vertue this Volume hath, to triumph over your moſt Beautiful Diſdains; to turn your Frowns into Smiles; your Angers into Kiſſes; to repreive thoſe whom you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtined for moſt bloody Sacrafices; to metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſe your Champion
<hi>Cupid</hi> from a Boy to a Man, to give him his eyes again, peruſe this Book, bright Ladies, and commend it to any of your modeſt Sex, that are troubled with the Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſs of Love, they cannot fail of a Remedy,
'tis <hi>Diana</hi>'s own Receipt Book. To conclude; I do not deſire that either of the Sexes ſhould take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tyrannous advantages over one anothers Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, neither would I bar them of their Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; but that after the Youths have plaid a while at Bo-peep, lookt Babies in one anothers eyes,

            <head>A ſhort Advertiſement to the Reader, by way of introduction, for his better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Myſteries of Eloquence and Complementing.</head>
            <p>HAving already in my Epiſtle to the Coy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams treated or rather traverſed, the paſſion of Love with a ſerious and light fancie, like <hi>Gallen</hi> and <hi>Donquixot,</hi> mixt together, to pleaſe as well the Stoical Student, as the moſt airy and fantaſtical Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant: I have ſince thought it no leſs my duty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of theſe two other myſteries, of Eloquence and Complementing. This task I might have evaded, ſince none of the former ſcriblers of Books, in this kind, ever particularly undertook theſe Subjects, which I muſt either impute to their ſimplicity or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs. Courteous Reader, Eloquence is ſo abſolutely neceſſary, and pertinent to humane converſe, that it cannot but be confeſſed by all intelligent perſons that in the management and conveyance even of reaſon it ſelf, it would be moſt expedient, that there ſhould be ſo many Artifices and Maſteries together, with moſt ſubtil Conducts; for without them a man cannot ſo well attain his ends. Hence it is that the Learned compare Eloquence to the Chymiſts Elixar; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all qualities in it, yet it ſhould not have one perceiveable: it is not to be denied, but that this age is that which expects that men ſhould learn the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick from their own Genius; or as ſome Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts writes of the Spider, that ſhe weaves her web out of her own bowels, or like our Enthuſiaſts, that
<pb facs="tcp:188088:12"/> pretend to inſpirations. It were to be wiſht Eloquence could be ſo attained, rather then that the Schools ſhould ſo manacle and fetter it with their old Maxims; but if theſe ſo pregnant perſons in their own imaginations did but rightly conſider what Eloquence is in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition; <hi>How that it is a way of ſpeech prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling over thoſe we have deſigned to prevail o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> and that it is ſo Etherial, or rather I cannot tell, how Divine, that it depends not alone on the ſingle Embroidry of words, but there muſt be ſomewhat more in it; an excellent knowlege of men, deep and ſtudied acquaintances with their paſſions: a man muſt not onely know very perfectly the agitations of his own mind, but be ſeen and converſant in thoſe of others; otherwiſe it wants that which animates and breaths a fire, which makes it both warm and ſhine. We ſay of Logick that it files and keels the reaſon of a man, which otherwiſe had been blunt in the wedge and tongue, which is the only diſtinction of a man from a bruit beaſt. The ſame may be ſaid of a perſon without behaviour and good language, that he is but a meer motion, a moſt ſad ſpectacle. Indeed this is our miſery, that though Eloquence be ſo abſolutely neceſſary, yet it is ſuch a thing of it ſelf, that though we make uſe of our quickeſt conceits, we can rather wiſh for it then deſcribe it in its perfect Idea; the Griſes of it having been ſo altered from time to time in all Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and publique Harrangues, in ſo much, that it cannot be amiſs to conſider how the ancient Orators that lead the people whither they pleaſed, were put to it, being forced to wreſtle with the diſadvantages of ſingle nature, ſo as at the laſt to divide and throw it into ſeveral Subjects, by which they reigned over
<pb facs="tcp:188088:13"/> the mindes of men, and did many ſtrange things, the end of Oratory being to perſwade.</p>
            <p>Thus having diſcourſed of Eloquence, I am now to deſcend to entertain ſome thoughts of her fair ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient Hand-maid, Complement. Civility is the moſt refined Complement; for as Complements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do but ſerve to compleat the Gentry, ſo where they are thus tendred, they are always in Faſhion; ever new, ever acceptable; and as they entertain a grace in the wearer, ſo they deſerve an admiration from the beholder. And thus they have in all ages been received for no leſs formal, then real accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments; and are held as moſt abſolute ornaments of Gentility. Complements were firſt intended to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt the Civil and the Savage; Perſons of Honour and Peaſants, yea, to appropriate a title of Prehemincy to ſuch, who exceed others in grounds of Precept of Morality; ſuch as uſed not paintick Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, but expreſs'd themſelves compleat without ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that could love without flattery, diſcourſe without affection, that freed Courtly Ceremonies from diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and made Vertue their Miſtreſs; that knew what it was to proteſt in jeaſt, and entertain Suitors onely for their Paſtime. All wiſe people are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently convinced, that Complements conſiſt not of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Cringes, Salutes, Superficial Diſcourſes, fooliſh Repetitions or frivilous Extravagances; theſe are but the ſhadows, which they that uſe forget the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: wheras the attraction and deſert of a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſts very much in the gracefulneſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, beautified and ſet forth with a modeſt and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive comelineſs; nor do I queſtion but theſe three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have many ſuch noble and compleat Ladies that
<pb facs="tcp:188088:13"/> prefer the inſide before the outſide, the kernel before the ſhell; that make honour the Load-ſtone, by which they daily draw near to perfection, their own proper Centre. Certain it is, that tho' our tongues, hands, and legs be the ſame, our Elocution, Action, Geſture, and Poſture are not the ſame; though managed in the like manner by others, yet are they not alwayes directed to the ſame ends, as there are vaſt differences to be made betwixt Vertue and Vice. I cannot want in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the fantaſtical Amoriſt is one of thoſe pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies that hath them in a continual practiſe; he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth will complement your very glove, worſhip and ſweeten every ſeam of it with the perfume of his diſcourſe; he will take it for an extraordinary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor but to be the porter of a Ladies Fan, whilſt ſhe pins on her Mask: theſe kind of complementings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong great perſons are like chantings among Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars; only in uſe with the Mimicks and Buffons of our times, whoſe behaviours deſerve more deriſion then applauſe. I will not here ſquirt any more ink at them, Courteous Reader, in my Preface to the youthful Gentry you ſhall find ſomething to this purpoſe inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which I accounted too improper for this place. To draw to a Concluſion, the Court, and ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent places as <hi>Hide Park,</hi> the <hi>Spring Garden,</hi> and the <hi>New Exchange,</hi> and ſet Meetings at Balls, are eſteemed the fitteſt Schools of Ceremony and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement; where the moſt ſelect, as alſo the neweſt Faſhions are alwayes in requeſt; where if diſcretion be not wanting in the Courtier, he will not fail to confirm himſelf to the mode and condition of the place that he is to exerciſe his Genius in. For Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements do not ſuit with all places, nor with all ſorts
<pb facs="tcp:188088:14"/> of men; it ill beſeems a Mechanick to play the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; that urbanity which becomes a Citizen, would reliſh of too much curioſity in a Countrey-man; and that Complement which gives proper grace to a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, would cauſe deriſion if preſented by a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant or a Factor. The Statesman requires a graceful and grave poſture, whereas in ordinary affairs of Traffique, it were indiſcretion to repreſent any ſuch ſtate. Thus I might inſtance from the Madam to the Chamber-maid, but that I am reſolved to trouble the Reader with no further Preadmonitions, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the enſuing Work will fully inform him in whatſoever other concernments have been wanting in this Advertiſement.

                  <p>Much diſcourſe cannot be expected from that reſtleſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Wheels and Horſes, it being only a preparative for treatment talk; neither indeed in that place of Obſervation, is more required, then only as occaſion ſerves, to tell your Lady, <hi>That is my Lord ſuch a ones Coach; That's my Lady ſuch a one; That's Squire ſuch a one.</hi> And then when opportunity offers it ſelf, to ſay, <hi>Your humble Servant; my Lord; Your moſt humble Servant, Madam.</hi> For though it be not ſo great a ſin, yet it is as great a Soleciſm, as to talk at Church; and they ſhall be counted as ſhallow perſons, that can give no account of what they have ſeen here, as thoſe that can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nothing that they have heard ſpoken to a Text. This is not without reaſon, for it being an impoſſibility for Ladies to travel, it was thought fit that there ſhould be a publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:188088:15"/> of all ſorts of Societies and Habits, both Forreign and Domeſtique, that ſo thoſe young and tender Gallants might be ſpar'd the labour of going beyond Sea.</p>
                  <p>In the ſpaces among the Coaches there walk up and down Objects of Charity, and Enticements to Liberality.</p>
                  <p>Beggars, and Fruiterers, who are bold Wenches, and by their own, well knowing the diſpoſition of other Women, with their Eyes fix'd upon the Ladies, and their Ware held up to the Gentlemen, they cry ſo as they may eaſily be heard,
<q>
                        <l>My Lord, Will your Honour have any Civil Oranges!</l>
                        <l>Madam, Will your Honour buy a Basket of Cherries!</l>
                     </q> The Gentleman finds himſelf ſurpriz'd, but knows not which to give, Oranges or Cherries; yet at length remembring Oranges. how great whetters of the ſtomach they are, and deeply conſidering the price of Cheeſecakes, he reſolves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Cherries.</p>
                  <p>Then quoth he, <hi>How do you ſell your Cherries, good Woman? A Crown a Basket, my Lord,</hi> quoth ſhe; with which word being extreamly pleaſed, he parts chearfully with his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (for who would not purchaſe Honour at any Rate) and then preſents his new bought treaſure to his Lady in theſe words:</p>
                  <sp>
                     <p>Madam, I do here preſent you with theſe Firſt-fruits of the Year, which would have been due from <hi>Romona</hi> her ſelf, had ſhe not forgot the duty that ſhe owes your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>The Lady makes a ſhort reply, well knowing the end of his kindneſs, which was to ſtop her mouth.</p>
                  <p>Whether Cherries are diuretick or no, I will not here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute; however, the Coachman preſently after hath a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given him to wheel off, and the Lady finds in her ſelf a diſpoſition to walk on foot toward the Brakes: yet ſhe is not ſo much tormented, but that ſhe can talk; which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly much to this effect:</p>
                  <sp>
                     <p>Really, Sir, I have not ſeen ſo great an appearance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the Park all this Spring before.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <p>Madam, it was the luſtre of your perſon drew 'em hither, and doubtleſs having now ſeen you, they will have no cauſe to repent their coming.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <p>Sir, you have a ſtrong faith to ſpeak ſo highly of one whom you have known no otherwiſe then in the formalities of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit?
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:188088:16"/> I wiſh I that know my ſelf better, knew my ſelf ſo well as to confirm your Encomiums.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <p>Madam, that lies not on your part to do, for wherefore hath Nature granted Man to excell in the invention of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but that ſhe would not ſo far deprave the dignity of the Female, which is her own Sex, as to make them the vain-glorious praiſers of themſelves; and it is retaliation ſufficient in you, to favour us with the acceptance of our Labours. I confeſs I am fallen upon a ſubject that I could dwell upon; I could make a particular harange in the praiſe of every part that builds up the noble Frame of your Body, but I am put to ſilence by that little Bird which warbles tydings of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to your ears. Do you not hear the Nightingale Madam?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <p>I do, Sir. And indeed it is the firſt time I have heard her this Spring. They ſay it is lucky to unmarried people to hear her before the Cuckow.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <p>Doubtleſs then, Madam, the end that brought her hither, was to bring you that good fortune.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <p>Sir, It cannot be but that you muſt have a greater ſhare in her happy Auguries, who better deſerve them.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <p>I ſhould then, Madam, deſerve your ſelf, which is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt Augury I can expect. Pardon me, Madam, if you have open'd my mouth to utter ſo great crime; for indeed I could ſay, I love you, but that I fear leſt you ſhould frown me into deſpair for ſuch a high preſumption.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <p>Believe it, Sir, my ambition never aſpir'd to ſuch thoughts, as you would fain put into me; but if you have idly ſcatter'd a little reſpect upon a perſon no way meriting, doubtleſs a few dayes and another Object wIll ſoon randezvouze your Paſſions another way.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <p>Madam, could any proteſtation avail to fix my Conſtancy in your belief, you ſhould ſoon command me to ſeal my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate Vows upon the Ground on which you tread; yet ſince that cannot be, I onely beg this on my knees, That you will ſtill count me your Servant, whom it ſhall ſuffice to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with that Liberty which you have hitherto given, till time ſhall diſcover my immutable Affection, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Teſtimonies of my Obedience.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>The Gentleman reſolves now to ſtrike while the Iron is hot, and to win her with kindneſs; for which end he carries her to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:188088:16"/> the Lodge, and throws away forty or fifty ſhillings to pleaſe her appetite; and to ſhew her that he was not ſo much cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of his Money, as of her Good Will: He breaks up Cheeſecakes, cuts up Tarts, and calls in for Wine and Sugar, as if his Miſtreſs had a Legion in her belly; though his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance is ſuch that he eats nothing himſelf, for fear ſhe ſhould have a deſire to any particular plum in his morſel, In drinking, he ſweetens her Affection with a great deal of Sugar with an humble obeyſance, wiſhing it were Nectar for her ſake. She cannot be ſo unmannerly as not to drink to him, there being no body elſe in the room, which he takes for a very great kindneſs, and wiſhes for the capacious throat of the great Gyant, that he might ſwill up a whole pipe for joy. The Wine inſpires him, and produces many extravagant Vows, and ſundry Comments on her Hands, Lips, Eyes, and Forehead; which beget an hoſt of Compariſons, putting ſuch a ſcorn and contempt upon the Sun and Moon, as if they were but meer Candles of Ten in the pound, ſubject to be capt by every common Extinguiſher. At length, emboldned by a ſurreptitious vapor, upon the merits of his Oblation, he craves a kiſs, which being granted, with a high ſatisfaction he calls to pay. This is the meek ſpirited Lover. But that bold Mamaluck Yclep'd, a Hector, courts his Lady more daringly.</p>
                  <p>Madam, cryes he, By Heaven I love you, and then he falls down with a ſubmiſſive reverence, and kiſſes the hem of her Petticoat; then ariſing up again, he proceeds, Madam there is no perſon living bears you a greater reſpect then I, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries more affection for you in his boſom then my ſelf; make trial of it, Madam, and though you bid me die, I'le do it willingly.</p>
                  <p>He comes into the Park, like the ſon of Death, arm'd with the accouterments of Mortality, Sword and Piſtol? he ſtands not much upon the nicety of Habit ſo his Belt be not out of faſhion. He is generally known in the Ring, and every one ſalutes him by the name of <hi>Tom</hi> or
<hi>Jack</hi> ſuch a one, whoſe kindneſs he requites with an Oath, and an Humble Servant: and ſo having done his Evening Exerciſe, he retires to the Lodge, where he ſpends his money with ſuch a liberality, as if he bore malice to his fortunes.</p>

But your favour, Sir, is too exceſſive, to attribute ſuch great praiſes to her that doth ſo little merit them, and which in compariſon to others, hath no one vertue to render her conſiderable.</p>

                     <p>Madam, your modeſty makes your ſpeak to your own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, and it may be permitted to you; but if I ſhould conſent to what you ſay, it would be a great fault in me; or if I ſhould diſſemble a truth which is ſo apparent to the eyes of the whole world, I ſhould render my ſelf altogether unworthy to behold ſo fair an object, ſhould I not know how to admire the wonders and graces of your beauty; the luſtre whereof, your modeſt expreſſions are not able to reclipſe. For my part, I cannot conceal how great a ſway you bear over my affections,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:188088:23"/> ſo that there is nothing in my power, that I do not freely dedicate to your ſervice.</p>

And therefore not judging my ſelf worthy the favours which you heap upon me, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intreat you, Sir, to change your diſcourſe.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall therefore come now more cloſe to the matter; the young Lady is the daughter of <hi>M.N.</hi> to whom her Mother left a very fair Eſtate, beſides a very fair Portion which her father intends to beſtow upon her.</p>

I ſee no reaſon, Faireſt, that the belief which I have taken with the cleareſt judgement that I have of your Beauty, ſhould be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd up by your misbelieving opinions.</p>

                        <hi>Madam,</hi> Time can do nothing againſt that which Love hath ordain'd; he is the maſter of Fortune, and an enemy to change. But wherefore this ſuperfluity of ſpeech? It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to believe by the force of Words, then by the force of Perſwaſion; and therefore at this time, it is more neceſſary for me, to demand of you Remedies for this remove, the apprehenſion whereof makes me endure this preſent pain.</p>

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <p>No, <hi>Madam,</hi> I will keep the memory of my Deſign eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and ſhall always ſee painted before me the glory of my Enterprize. Adieu great Beauty, you ſhall never caſt your eyes downward, but you ſhall perceive, lying at your feet, him that admires you; nor ever elevate your Thoughts to your deſerts, but you ſhall remember your conqueſt. Adieu Faireſt, for now I leave the Sun, and go to ſeek out Night and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows cell.</p>

                  <hi>Gentleman,</hi> ſtep in and ſee the begining; here is a Lady worth your ſeeing, She was born like <hi>Minerva,</hi> for ſhe hath been breeding like mites in old cheeſe, in the heads of ſeveral Poets for this thouſand years. Who have at length produc'd her to out-miracle the Hairy Gentlewoman; being quite contrary to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:188088:40"/> her, for hair ſhe hath none, her head being cover'd with an <hi>Aurora</hi> colour'd ſilk, which hangs diſ-ſhevel'd about her ſhoulders; inſtead of curls it is ty'd in nooſes, ſuch as they catch Jacks withall, with which ſhe recreates her ſelf in fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Gudgeons. Her fore-head is a Tower planted all about with <hi>Cupids</hi> artillery; The whole ſtructure of her head re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles a ſtately Palace; Her noſe is the Throne where <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> himſelf ſits under the Arches of her brows, which are not brows but two rainbows, to ſignifie the watry temper of their eyes; Inſtead of her eyes ſhe hath two burning Torches in each hole, and here by the way, the Poets tell a ſtory, how that <hi>Cupid</hi> about a hundred years ago ſing'd his wings in the flames thereof, and falling into one of the corners, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt drown'd in the Rhume; Her lips are two Altars of red Coral, continually reeking with the incenſe that comes from her mouth; Her teeth are not made of bone like thoſe of other Women, but of the tears of true lovers congealed into pearl; Her Neck is nothing but a cloud, out of which you may ſee a Sun break forth to enlighten the two Orbs of her breaſt; though indeed they are not ſo properly to be termed Orbs, as Mountains, reſembling the two hillocks that are upon Mount <hi>Parnaſſus;</hi> theſe overlook her belly, which is not a belly, but rather a plain, large and ſmooth, like that near

He ought to have haunted Dancing Scools with more zeal then the old Women have that go to St. <hi>Antlins;</hi> He ought diligently to have ſtudied over <hi>Melchior Swaſhbucklerus, de hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo hattum in hando,</hi> and <hi>Cuffius Candus</hi> of the Ornaments of Nations; he ought to be a diligent Obſerver of Faſhions, and an eſpyer of faults in the garb and houſe-keeping of other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that he may be able to furniſh his own Lady now and then with diſcourſe.

The firſt two days he muſt walk in iron Boots, and an iron Breaſt and Back-piece, ſuch as children wear that have the rickets, to bring his body into an upright and perfect po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. After that he muſt drink Scurvygraſs-Ale to reform his complexion. He muſt then furniſh himſelf with all the Books of Complementing, and be ſure to get enough to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to ſhew his wit the firſt night before the Waiting Gentlewoman at the Stewards Table. His motion muſt be with ſuch a Clock-work formality, as if he were only made to ſtrike the Quarter-Bell upon Bow-Steeple. This muſt be practiſed every morning in his Looking-glaſs, and he muſt not ſuffer himſelf to eat until he find he hath profited ſomething.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:188088:41"/> He ought in company to value himſelf according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of his Lady, wherein he muſt have a care not to loſe the leaſt atome of her dignity. His pockets muſt not be greaſie, becauſe he may have occaſion to carry his Ladies Hoods and Scarfs in them.

The heels of his Shoes ought to be long and very ſlender, that he may tread with the more grace, and make the leſs noiſe. His clothes ought to be put on with ſo much accurateneſs, as if he were to dreſs himſelf every day for his life, or if the world would periſh, were there a wrinkle in his Band; white Gloves he muſt not want, for they like white ſtaves in other employments, are the badges of his preferment.

                  <p>The other is the dwindling away of the calves of his legs; This happens from his being overtoyl'd; for being to divide himſelf between the Lady and her Woman, they never leave ſucking him, till they have made him ſo tranſparent that you may ſee his very thoughts. For the cure of this diſeaſe, he muſt go to the Hoſier inſtead of the Apothecary.

                     <hi>LAdy,</hi> The continuance of your melancholy having toucht me ſo far, as to make me partake of your grief, wonder not if you receive theſe undeſerved lines from me, which I hope will wipe away your tears, if you conſider him that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats you to be pitiful to himſelf; if not, to his youth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, Deareſt, my ſorrows for your ſelf carry more reaſon with them, then yours for your deceaſed Brother, which can have no other pretence than cuſtom, and your good nature. Pardon me if I tell you freely, that if you do not decline your grief, I ſhall abate of the belief I had of your ſpirit. I know well that the loſs of Friends muſt needs touch us, nor would I remove the ſenſe of mourning, but the error; not the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of tears, but the ſuperfluity of them. For though we muſt give ſomething to nature, let us not take away all from reaſon; neither doth Nature ſo much as Opinion prevail over in theſe extreams of ſorrow. Believe me, Fair one, ſorrow hath plac'd you too near the grave, that ſhould you look in your glaſs, you would already conceive your ſelf there: for never did tears deal more cruelly with any than your ſelf; ſeeing they have mind at once two of the faireſt things in the world, the clearneſs of your diſpoſition and beauty. Judge therefore, whether I have not as much cauſe to lament with you, as to write to you. At leaſt I hope you will of your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thoughts, to conſider a little of him, who with tears en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats you to conſider of your ſelf, as being</p>

                  <p>I Believe that if you have been the laſt who have underſtood the death of your Servant, that you will be one of the firſt, and indeed the onely perſon, who will in your ſoul celebrate
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:188088:85"/> the ſad remembrance of him, a much longer time than any of his Friends: not that his merit doth oblige you, for I well know that all merit loſes its eſteem in your preſence, being ſo perfect as you are; nor your Piety, though it be a thing natural to you with your other vertues; but only his love, and conſtancy, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both equally incomparable. Neither do I believe, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe do oblige you at all, for though his love were very great, that could not be otherwiſe, ſeeing you were his object, no more than his conſtancy whatever it were; ſo that to ſay the truth, I know not what can urge you to bewail his loſs, unleſs it be the goodneſs of your inclinations, being as mild and ſweet as you are, fair, and conſequently full of Piety. I ſhould weep my ſelf, for having the leaſt thought to condemn your tears, yet give me leave to believe, that when you remember that the fires pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from your eyes did help to conſume his life, it would make them weep for ſorrow. Now what puniſhment will you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon your Beauty, if there be nothing in you that hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken of the millions of pains which he hath endured for your ſake: Certainly you ought to ſuffer Shipwrack in the Sea of your tears, unleſs the God of Love have need of you for one of his Altars. Since you are the only Idol, to whom all mortals will preſent the ſacrifices of their Servitude. And as for my ſelf, who have undertaken to ſucceed to the merits and conſtancy of your deceaſed Servant, I will not give aſſurances in words, for deeds themſelves ſhall always be my ſureties.

In the firſt place, I counſel thee O man or woman, who ere thou art, that doſt profeſs the cure of Venereal Diſtempers, to avoid that common fault among all the Profeſſors thereof, which is Coveteouſneſs. For if a young man or a young woman hath by chance got a Clap, and is willing to give all he hath, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to endure the diſeaſe long, wilt thou be ſo baſe and ſordid, to make his or her earneſt deſire to be the cauſe of thy exaction. Aſſure thy ſelf that money got by ſuch exaction, will be a worm to conſume that part of thy Eſtate which thou haſt honeſtly got. In the next place, be not too inquiſitive of any Patient who he is, and where he dwells; for if he have not a mind to tell thee, what haſt thou to do to enquire any thing concerning him? Thirdly, judge not raſhly of him, as who ſhould ſay, you have been lying with a Wench; for you cannot but know that there are many ways of getting Claps beſide that one; as by drinking with the party, lying in a hot bed with him, ſitting upon a cloſe-ſtool after him; as alſo by lifting, riding, or any other manner of ſtraining. Then let every Patient receive his cure with all privacy. And laſtly, do not flatter me daily with any patient whatſoever. This is the part which ye have to act upon the Theatre of this world, which, if thou doſt not juſtly perform, conſider, I ſay, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that you muſt make your exits into Stoves and Sweating-tubs, much hotter then thoſe with which you ever afflicted your patients withall, being on earth. Heaven direct your courſe, that you may be neither Cheaters, Impoſters, nor Cozeners, as moſt are who profeſs the cure of Venereal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers; but that ye may be in this, as well as in all your other actions, faithful and honeſt; which is the daily wiſh of</p>

                  <p>AND by that word you may know I am no zuch Clown as you may take me for, in good ſooth law now, your fair face hath wounded me to the very hart, ſo that I would give all the old Shoes in my Sack to enjoy the happineſs of your ſweet company. I know that Ladies love variety, ſo that I am bold to think it would be no ſmall recreation to you, when you have been glutted with the company of your ſilk and ſatten Gallants, to converſe two or three hours with a tatterd Broom-man. I have heard in ſome Ballads, how the Gods did condeſcend to come upon the earth, and dine with poor people; much leſs therefore ſhould you being but a mortal Lady, diſdain to eat a peice of bread and cheeſe, now and then, with a ſorry Broom-man. There is a Proverb that tells the Gentlemen, that <hi>Jone</hi> is as good as my Lady in the dark: and why ſhould there not be another Proverb to tell the Gentlewomen, That <hi>Tom</hi> is as good as my Lord in the dark. I do not want examples to tell you, how that the Queen of Fairies married a Tinker, and of ſeveral Ladies that have married their Gentlemen Uſhers, others their Fathers Grooms, and others their Butlers. Now I believe my ſelf not inferiour to any of thoſe. As for what you, as a Woman, can expect from a man, I know my ſelf ſufficiently able, of which I have ſent you a Certificate, ſigned with the Marks of moſt of the pretty Laſſes in this ſtreet; neither do I doubt of the continuance thereof, unleſs your hard heart do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume my marrow with grief and anguiſh of mind; do not therefore kill me, who though I am but a Broom-man. dare ſwear my ſelf as faithful a Servant to you, as any man in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, France</hi> or
<hi>Ireland.</hi> Pray ſend me word by this Bearer, for I ſtay within in great perplexity, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtir abroad with my Ware till I hear your Anſwer.</p>

So that even as a Woman with Child longeth for the corner of an Apple-tart, or a piece of raw Mutton, ſo do I thirſt after thee; and even as a Virgin that eateth Chalk, and drinketh Vinegar, looks pale, &amp; loſeth her ſtomach, ſo do I look pale with languiſhing for thee, and my belly is ſhrunk up for want of food; for I have not eaten above half a ſurloin of Beef, forty tythe Egs, thirty black Puddings, and five great brown Apple-pies, ſince Sunday laſt, that your Father took me home

I ſhall put it to thy choice, whether thou wilt be courted in publick or in private; for I have made five delicate Sermons upon the moſt amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous place in all the <hi>Canticles,</hi> wherewithall to allure thee into my embraces. If thou doſt conſent, then will I go to thy mother, and as the childe deſireth the maid to ſpread him ſome bread and butter for his afternoons Luncheon, ſo will I deſire her to give thee unto me that I may ſpread my my ſelf upon thee. If ſhe replyeth, Yea, Then will I ſpeak to her in the words of Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I thank you hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily good Mother.</hi> But if ſhe ſay unto me, Nay, then as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath it very well: <hi>I ſhall be ready to hang my ſelf.</hi> Be thou therefore my preſerver, and my interceſſour, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou mayeſt want a Husband, nor the Pariſh a Miniſter, nor thy Mother a Man to devour her bag puddings.</p>

                  <p>I No ſooner ſaw you, but the tinder of my affection began to take fire. For your beauty was to me like the hearb <hi>Larix,</hi> cool in the water, but hot in my ſtomack. So that as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did long to know his dream, ſo did I long to know what would become of me, as to your good liking of me. Be not therefore a beauty without compaſſion, which is like a Mandrake apple, comely in ſhew; but poiſonful in taſte. But woe is me, for I find that my words have wrought no more impreſſion on your heart then an arrow on a rock of Adamant. So that I may ſay of you, that as in the greeneſt Graſs is the greateſt Serpent, in the cleareſt Water the uglieſt Toad; ſo is your fair Body lin'd with a cruel Soul. Alas, you have no mercy on my captivity, ſo that I am like the Spaniel that gnaws his chain, but ſooner ſpoils his teeth then procures liberty. But as a Bladder is to a learning Swimmer, ſo is Hope to me; which makes me apt to believe, that as there is no Iron but will be ſoftned with the fire, ſo there is no Heart how hard ſo ever, that will not be ſoft-by continual prayers. I confeſs my expreſſion is but like a

However conſider, that the Sun diſdains not to ſhine upon the ſmalleſt Worm. Reconcile your ſelf to the humbleſt of your Vaſſals, and do not through your Marble-hearted-cruelty utterly overwhelm him with Sence-diſtracting grief, like a Current that breaks the Dams, and with a vigorous impetuouſneſs drowns the Fields.</p>

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:188088:172"/> when as all of them are diſputed and concluded contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of ſeveral things by theſe only ſyllogiſms; it ſeemeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be only method, is it not?</hi>

                           <hi>A.</hi> The Logician by this light of artificial method ſelected out of this pot the definition of Grammer; (for that is moſt general) and placeth it in the firſt place: Grammer is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſpeaking well. Then he taketh out of the ſame Oven the partit on of Grammer, and placeth it in the ſecond place. The part 1 of Grammer are two; Etimology and Syntaxis. Then outs of the ſame veſſel he ſeperateth the definition of Etimology of words, and joyneth it in the third place to thoſe that go before: then he ſeeketh out parts of words in letters and ſyllables, and the kinds in words of number, and without number; and placeth them with their tranſcitions in their ſeveral places. And ſo the definitions of all the parts of Eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molog, together with their diſtributions, colligations, and moſt ſpecial examples he placeth in their ſeveral places, and ſo likewiſe in the Syntax. This way all the arts have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to themſelves.</p>

Then the tranſcition is adhibited in the beginning of the ſecond book.

                        </p>
                        <p>Then he writeth generally of trees, as alſo ſpecially of plants; the ſecond tranſcition is adhibited to the third part, but
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:188088:173"/> more imperfect and without an Epilogue. In the beginning of the third book of Oxen, Horſes, Sheep, Goats, Dogs.

                        <p>By and by having made imploration, he determineth the partition of the year made firſt by <hi>Romulus</hi> into ten months, which he reprehendeth.
<q>
                              <l>When as <hi>Romes</hi> builder did the year divide,</l>
                              <l>In it he made five moneths, and five beſide.</l>

                        </p>
                        <p>Here the Poet having interpreted the common differences of Holy-dayes, Working-dayes, Banquet-days, Kalends, Nones, Ides; at the laſt he followeth every moneth in his place, and with a preface after this order he paſſeth from generals to the ſtudy of ſpecials.

                        <p> A. The Orators in Poems, Narrations, Confirmations, Perorations do follow this order, as the nature both of the art, and the order of the thing do require, and ſometimes more ſtudiouſly too.</p>

                        <p>A. <hi>Cicero</hi> in an accuſation firſt by propounding, then by parting, followeth this order. <hi>Queſtor Cu. paxeris,</hi> ſaith he, thou haſt been Conſul unto this time fourteen years, and from that day unto this day in which thou haſt made me, I call thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to judgement; there was no void hour found in robbery, wickedneſs, cruelty, iniquity. This is the propoſition and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the chief matter, as in this judgement moſt gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. The partition followeth: Theſe are the years conſumed in the queſtorſhip, and a Sciatican embaſſage, and the Urban pretorſhip, and in the Sicilian pretorſhip: wherefore this ſhall be the fourfold diſpoſition of my accuſation; which four parts with their particular partitions he hath alſo handl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ſeveral order and place, and coupled them with tranſcitions; the three firſt in the third book. Wherefore (ſaith he) his queſtorſhip being ſhewed, and his firſt magiſtracy, together with his theft and wickedneſs looked unto, let us attend to the reſt. Then having expounded the faults of his embaſſadorſhip, the tranſcition to his pretorſhip, followeth. But let us now come to that famous pretorſhip, and thoſe faults which were more known to thoſe which were preſent, then to us who come meditated and prepared to pleading. This tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cition is more imperfect without an epilogue: at length in the beginning of the fourth oration, there is the like tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cition to the fourth part of the Sicilian pretorſhip. Many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things, O Judges, I muſt pretermit, that I may in ſome manner ſpeak of thoſe things which are commited to my truſt, for I have received the cauſe of Sicilia, that province hath drawn me unto this buſineſs.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>A.</hi> Yes, when as the auditor ſhall be deceived in a certain part with delectation, and a greater motion then certain homogenes are rejected, as the lights of definition, partition, and tranſcition: and certain heterogenes are aſſumed; as digreſſions from the matter, and commemorations upon the thing; but chiefly the order of things in the beginnings is turned over, and certain antecedents are put after conſequents. Therefore to that rule of perfect method, this may ſeem ſomewhat more imperfect; the form is not only lame things being detracted; or abounding, things being added; but alſo the order of it being inverted by certain degrees, is prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>

So as (<hi>Horace</hi> ſaith) <hi>Homer</hi> diſpoſeth his Iliads.
<q>
                              <l>Ne doth this man <hi>Troy's</hi> Wars divide ſo well,</l>
